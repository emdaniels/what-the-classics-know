What The Classics Know Of Blue
==============================

I was quite curious after reading an article on Business Insider that 
stated that we couldn't see the color blue until modern times, which 
was 'proven' by the analysis done in 1858 by a scholar named William 
Gladstone. 

Gladstone decided to count the color references in Homer's Odyssey 
and in other ancient Greek texts and concluded that 'blue' wasn't 
mentioned. This analysis was followed up by a philologist named Lazarus 
Geiger, who studied Icelandic sagas, the Koran, ancient Chinese stories, 
and the Bible who also ultimately concluded that there was no mention of 
'blue'. 

Fascinated by this, I decided to write a program to analyze the texts
these scholars had chosen, along with other books deemed by western 
civilization to be classic pieces of literature to see if this really 
was true. Turns out, no- it's not. Both Gladstone and Geiger should have
found several references to the color blue in these texts. Too bad they
didn't have access to the tools we have today for deeper analysis and 
study.
 
What is even more unfortunate is that the author of the article didn't
check to see if this was actually this case before writing this piece. 
Always check your sources.
