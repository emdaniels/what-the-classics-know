02:025:003 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold,
           and silver, and brass,

02:025:004 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'

02:025:007 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the
           breastplate.

02:026:001 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of
           fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with
           cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.

02:026:002 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits,
           and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of
           the curtains shall have one measure.

02:026:004 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one
           curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt
           thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the
           coupling of the second.

02:026:031 And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it
           be made:

02:026:032 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood
           overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the
           four sockets of silver.

02:026:036 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of
           blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought
           with needlework.

02:027:016 And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty
           cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined
           linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be
           four, and their sockets four.

02:028:005 And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine linen.

02:028:006 And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple,

02:028:008 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall
           be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold,
           of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

02:028:015 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
           work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold,
           of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined
           linen, shalt thou make it.

02:028:028 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto
           the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be
           above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the
           breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.

02:028:031 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

02:028:033 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
           blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem
           thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:

02:028:034 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a
           pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.

02:028:037 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the
           mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

02:035:004 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
           Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded,
           saying,

02:035:005 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is
           of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD;
           gold, and silver, and brass,

02:035:006 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
           hair,

02:035:007 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
           wood,

02:035:008 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for
           the sweet incense,

02:035:009 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for
           the breastplate.

02:035:023 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
           scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of
           rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

02:035:024 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass
           brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was
           found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

02:035:025 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
           hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and
           of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

02:035:035 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner
           of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of
           the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in
           fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work,
           and of those that devise cunning work.

02:036:008 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
           the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and
           blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work
           made he them.

02:036:009 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
           breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of
           one size.

02:036:011 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
           selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost
           side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

02:036:035 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
           twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

02:036:037 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
           purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

02:036:038 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid
           their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five
           sockets were of brass.

02:038:018 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of
           blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and
           twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth
           was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

02:038:023 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of
           Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in
           blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

02:039:001 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
           service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy
           garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:002 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine twined linen.

02:039:003 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into
           wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the
           scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

02:039:005 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of
           the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and
           purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:039:008 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of
           the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
           twined linen.

02:039:021 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings
           of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the
           curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might
           not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:022 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

02:039:024 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,
           and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

02:039:027 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and
           for his sons,

02:039:028 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen,
           and linen breeches of fine twined linen,

02:039:029 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
           scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:031 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high
           upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

04:004:004 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the
           tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:

04:004:005 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his
           sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover
           the ark of testimony with it:

04:004:006 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and
           shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in
           the staves thereof.

04:004:007 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of
           blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the
           bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread
           shall be thereon:

04:004:008 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover
           the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in
           the staves thereof.

04:004:009 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick
           of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his
           snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they
           minister unto it:

04:004:010 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a
           covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

04:004:011 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
           and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put
           to the staves thereof:

04:004:012 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith
           they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of
           blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and
           shall put them on a bar:

04:004:013 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread
           a purple cloth thereon:

04:004:014 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith
           they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and
           the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and
           they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and
           put to the staves of it.

04:015:037 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:015:038 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make
           them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their
           generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders
           a ribband of blue:

04:015:039 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon
           it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do
           them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own
           eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

04:015:040 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy
           unto your God.

14:002:007 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
           silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,
           and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men
           that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my
           father did provide.

14:002:011 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent
           to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath
           made thee king over them.

14:002:012 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that
           made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise
           son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build
           an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

14:002:013 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding,
           of Huram my father's,

14:002:014 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was
           a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in
           brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue,
           and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of
           graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to
           him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord
           David thy father.

14:003:014 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and
           fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

17:001:005 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto
           all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both
           unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden
           of the king's palace;

17:001:006 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with
           cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of
           marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of
           red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.

17:008:015 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
           apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and
           with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of
           Shushan rejoiced and was glad.

24:010:009 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold
           from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the
           founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the
           work of cunning men.

26:023:005 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted
           on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,

26:023:006 Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them
           desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.

26:027:006 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company
           of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out
           of the isles of Chittim.

26:027:007 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
           spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles
           of Elishah was that which covered thee.

26:027:024 These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue
           clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel,
           bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
